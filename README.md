Natural language processing project 1 is to analysis a manually annotation work
including a quantitative analysis and a qualitative analysis. The annotation is done by all
classmates based on a classification scheme. The quantitative analysis uses inter- annotator agreement statistics to measure own agreement with the rest of the class and to
estimate human performance on the task. The qualitative analysis is to present a critique
of the annotation task, the annotation scheme, the annotation process and web-based
annotation tool, and the problem more generally of assigning categories to complex
linguistic and ontological phenomena. 


Natural language processing project 2 is firstly to train and evaluate a statistical text
classification system, and next analyse errors produced by a statistical text classification
system, and then give reason about how feature extraction approaches may enhance the
representation of language for text classification, and validate this through empirical
experimentation, and finally discuss how different classification tasks (e.g. sentiment vs. Topic classification) may require different feature engineering. 


Natural language processing project 3 is to implement the Viterbi algorithm and a
Maximum Entropy Markov Model for predicting the best tag sequence and explore
possible feature sets and perform experiments comparing them. Next is to evaluate the
performance of the established system on English and German.
